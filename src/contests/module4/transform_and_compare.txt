Transform and Compare

Given a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters, such as "RXXLRXRXL", a move can be made by replacing either one
occurrence of "XL" with "LX" or one occurrence of "RX" with "XR". The task is to determine if it is possible to
transform the starting string, "start," into the ending string, "end," by a sequence of these moves. Return True only if such a sequence exists.

Example 1:

Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output: true
Explanation:
The starting string can be transformed into the ending string using the following steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX

Example 2:

Input: start = "LLR", end = "RRL"
Output: false



Exercise-1

Input:
RXXLRXRXL
XRLXXRRLX

Output:
true

Exercise-2

Input:
RXXL
XRLX

Output:
true
