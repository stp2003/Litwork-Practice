Problem Statement

Close the brackets

You are given a set of strings, each consisting of brackets (, ), {, }, [, or ]. A bracket is considered an
opening bracket if it is one of (, {, or [, and it is considered a closing bracket if it is one of ), }, or ].

A string of brackets is considered balanced if it meets the following conditions:

It contains no unmatched brackets.
For every opening bracket, there is a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and the brackets are properly nested.

Your task is to determine, for each given string, whether it is balanced or not. If a string is balanced, output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".
