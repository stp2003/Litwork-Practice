Number of Provinces

The problem is to determine the number of provinces in a given set of cities. Each city can be directly or indirectly connected to other cities.
If city A is directly connected to city B, and city B is directly connected to city C, then city A is indirectly connected to city C.
A province is a group of cities that are directly or indirectly connected to each other, and there are no other cities outside of this group.

You are given a matrix isConnected, where isConnected[i][j] is equal to 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and 0 otherwise.
The task is to find the total number of provinces present in the given matrix.
